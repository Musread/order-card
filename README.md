# Order summary card

Welcome 🖐 !

This is another project from FrontendMentor that I've done. This time, it's about a well-designed order card. I let you check it out here : https://musread.github.io/order-card

## Packages that I used

As always :

# The difficulties I met building this project 🥵

## Grid Layouts

For the first time, I try to build an entire layout by using the grid system. I really like the grid layout's approach, but I'n not familiar with the code that came with 😅.

## Box shadow design

This is my forever struggle. When it comes to use the "box-shadow" property, I'm always confusing about how much blur I should use, or what will be the position fo the shadow to really make a button looks like...a button 😅. If someone has great tips about how to use "box-shadow" properly, you're welcomed !

I don't have a website yet, because I have no ideas about the design. But here's my FrontendMentor profile : [@musread](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/musread)
